Generative adversarial networks, GANs have become the basis for many applications of generative modeling.

_Generative Modeling is a basis for applications of_:

* Text generation - Fake News
* Facial swapping - Deep Fakes
* Pose translation
* Static image animation
* Medical imaging analysis
* Generating fake art
* Feature image analysis
* Restoring images and video
  
GANs provide a foundation for building generative modeling on many and varied applications.
